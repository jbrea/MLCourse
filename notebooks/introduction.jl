Hi and welcome to the first exercise session of this introduction to machine learning.

The goal of this week is to
1. decide which programming language you want to use
2. setup an environment and install some dependencies that we will use in the future
3. solve some exercises to generate, visualize and inspect some data.

# 1. Choice of Programming Language

Popular programming languages for work with data and machine learning allow high
interactivity, either through a [Read-eval-print loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) or interactive notebooks, like [Jupyter notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter).
The name "Jupyter" is a reference to the programming languages **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon and **R**, which are among the most popular languages to work with data.
For this introduction to machine learning it does not really matter which of these three languages one chooses.
In fact, the code examples for this course will be given in Julia and Python and you can switch forth and back between these two languages with the language toggle button:

... and for R (and Python) there are also many code examples in the excellent textbook ["Introduction to Statistical Learning"](https://www.statlearning.com/).

Although it does not matter which language you choose for this course, it may be worthwhile to know a bit more about the pros and cons of each language. On the internet one can find many articles comparing those three languages; as a tiny overview the following table may help.

At some point in your career you will probably program in each of these languages.
For now you should decide, if you want to use this course to explore at the same time a new programming language or if you prefer to improve your skills in a language you know already.

# 2. Setup Programming Environment

Once you have chosen the programming language, you should decide which editor to use.
We recommend for all languages the [VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Alternatives include VIM/NeoVIM, Emacs, Rstudio, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks/Lab.

If you use VS Code we recommend installing the ["julia extension"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia).

In a terminal, for example in the VS Code terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to store the exercise solution files and open julia there.
In the julia REPL press `]` to enter the package manager.
Create a new environment with

```julia
(@v1.10) pkg> activate MLCourse # creates a new environment
(MLCourse) pkg> add DataFrames, Distributions, Plots, CSV, OpenML
```
Leave package mode with the `backspace` key and load the packages you want with
```julia
julia> using DataFrames, Distributions, Plots
```

Whenever you want to go back to working with this environment, navigate to the folder that contains `MLCourseSolutions`, open julia, type `]` and run again
```julia
(@v1.10) pkg> activate MLCourseSolutions
```

#### MLCourse environment

$(DownloadButton("name: MLCourse\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.10\n  - numpy=1.26\n  - scikit-learn\n  - matplotlib\n  - pandas\n  - openml\n  - seaborn\n  - ca-certificates\n  - openssl\n  - jupyter\n", "BIO322.yml"))Download the environment file and run:
```python
conda env create -f BIO322.yml
conda activate MLCourse
```


In case you would like to build the environment yourself, run:

```python
conda create -n MLCourse python=3.10.8
conda activate MLCourse
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install openml
pip install seaborn
```

#### VSCode extensions
Download these extensions in the VSCode extensions tab

- Python from Microsoft
- Pylance from Microsoft
- Python Indent from Kevin Rose
- if you want to work with Jupyter notebooks: all the Jupyter extensions from Microsoft
- (optional): autoDocstrings from Nils Werner

How to use your newly created environment with VSCode:

In VSCode you can open a terminal by clicking in the bottom left corner.
A pop-up with Terminal, Problemsn Output, Debug Console, ... should appear.

#### Working with Python files

Create a new python script (.py) file.
Click in the bottom right corner and a pop-up "Select Interpreter" should
appear. Please choose your 'MLCourse':conda environment.
Now you can click on the play button on the top right corner to execute a
script or Shift+Enter to run singles lines or blocks of code.

If you prefer terminal commands you can always use:
```
conda activate MLCourse
python my_file_name.py
```

#### Working with Conda

Download a new package:

```bash
conda activate MLCourse
pip install new_package_name # via pip (preferred option)
conda install new_package_name # via Conda

conda list # make a list of all the package you have
```

#### Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode
Independently of the language you use, you can work with Jupyter notebooks.
I'm unsure, if I should recommend working with Jupyter notebooks, however.
Although I used them in the past, I prefer now working with scripts and
work interactively with an open REPL. For example, in VSCode you can select a block of code and send it to the terminal with Shift+Enter.

If you prefer to work with jupyter notebooks, create a new jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file.
In top right corner click on "Select Kernel" and choose your MLCourse environment.
Execute cells by hitting Shift + Enter.

## Conceptual
#### Exercise 1
   Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and
   indicate whether we are most interested in interpretation or accurate prediction.
   Finally, provide ``n``, the number of samples, and ``p``, the number of dimensions of the input.
   - We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we
     record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are
     interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.
   - We are considering launching a new product and wish to know
     whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20
     similar products that were previously launched. For each product
     we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price
     charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price,
     and ten other variables.
   - We are interested in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro
     exchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world
     stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For
     each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the %
     change in the US market, the % change in the British market,
     and the % change in the German market.

#### Exercise 2
A common "trick" to generate 100 samples of a binary variable with probability ``p = 0.7`` for `true` (and probability ``1-p = 0.3`` for `false`) is to run the code

## Applied

We will work a lot with real and artificial datasets.
To prepare for this work, we will familiarize ourselves in these exercises with the creation and manipulation of dataframes, loading and saving of data and plotting.

Knowing the tools for these tasks is essential. You should therefore spend some time looking at the documentation of the following packages:

3. Produce a scatter plot that shows the `sepallength` versus the `sepalwidth`. Make sure both axes have the correct label.
4. Add to the same plot the "identiy"-line ``y = x`` in red.
